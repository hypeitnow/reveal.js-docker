## What We’ll Cover Today
- Helm: Concept and Advantages for Microservices
- How Helm Works and Common Commands
- Writing Helm Charts: 101
- Kustomize: Concept, Use Cases, and Comparison with Helm
- ArgoCD: Automating Deployments with GitOps
- Combining Helm, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes for Speed and Efficiency

---

## What is Helm?
- Kubernetes Package Manager
- Manages Kubernetes Applications via Charts
- Simplifies Deployment, Upgrades, Rollbacks, and Configuration Management

---

## Helm Key Concepts
- **Charts**: Pre-configured Kubernetes resources
- **Releases**: Deployed instances of charts
- **Repositories**: Places to store and share charts

---

## Why Helm is Great for Microservices
- **Simplified Deployments**: Deploy multiple services together
- **Version Control**: Rollback and control versions of services
- **Reusability**: Charts can be shared across teams and environments
- **Upgrades and Rollbacks**: Quickly update or revert services in production

---

## Helm Architecture & Components
- Helm 3 (No Tiller) interacts directly with Kubernetes API
- **Chart Structure**:
    - `Chart.yaml`
    - `Values.yaml`
    - `Templates/`
    - `Requirements.yaml` (dependencies)

---

## Helm’s Core Workflow
1. **Install**: Deploy charts to the Kubernetes cluster
2. **Upgrade**: Update existing deployments
3. **Rollback**: Revert to a previous version
4. **Uninstall**: Remove resources from the cluster

---

## Most Useful Helm Commands
- `helm create <chart-name>`: Create a new chart
- `helm install <release-name> <chart>`: Install a chart
- `helm list`: List all releases
- `helm upgrade <release-name> <chart>`: Upgrade a release
- `helm rollback <release-name> <revision>`: Rollback to a previous release
- `helm template <chart>`: Render charts locally
- `helm lint <chart>`: Validate a chart structure

---

## Writing a Helm Chart: Step-by-Step
1. **Create the Chart**: `helm create <chart-name>`
2. **Edit `Chart.yaml`**: Define metadata
3. **Modify `Values.yaml`**: Set default values
4. **Write Templates**: Use Go templating for Kubernetes manifests
5. **Test and Deploy**:
    - `helm lint`: Validate chart
    - `helm install <release-name> ./<chart-name>`: Install chart

---

## What is Kustomize?
- Kubernetes Configuration Management Tool
- Works by **overlaying configurations** on top of base manifests
- **No templating**: Directly manipulates YAML files
- Natively integrated into `kubectl`

---

## Why Use Kustomize?
- **No Templating**: Simple overlays without template logic
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Manage configurations for different environments
- **Built-in to kubectl**: Easy to integrate into Kubernetes workflows

---

## Using Kustomize for Multiple Environments
- Create **base** resources and **overlays** for each environment
- Example structure:
    ```yaml
    └── k8s/
        ├── base/
        ├── overlays/
            ├── dev/
            └── prod/
    ```
- Apply configurations using: `kubectl apply -k overlays/dev/`

---

## Helm vs Kustomize: Key Differences
- **Helm**: Templating engine + package management
- **Kustomize**: Configuration layering without templating
- **Helm** is more flexible for complex applications, while **Kustomize** is simpler for managing environment-specific configs

---

## What is ArgoCD?
- GitOps-based Continuous Delivery tool for Kubernetes
- Automatically syncs Kubernetes clusters with Git repositories
- Ensures the **desired state** in Git matches the **actual state** in the cluster

---

## Why Use ArgoCD?
- **Automated Deployments**: Syncs Kubernetes clusters with Git
- **Self-Healing**: Auto-fixes drift between desired and actual states
- **Declarative GitOps**: Git is the source of truth for Kubernetes configurations

---

## The Power of Combining Helm, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes
- **Helm**: Simplifies app management with charts
- **ArgoCD**: Automates continuous deployment using GitOps principles
- **Kubernetes**: The container orchestration platform
- **Benefits**:
    - Continuous, automated deployment
    - Rollback capabilities with Helm
    - Git as a source of truth

---

## Speeding Up Workflows
- **Helm** + **ArgoCD** enables fast, reliable deployments
- Reduces manual intervention
- **GitOps** ensures environments stay in sync
- Simplifies the pipeline from development to production

---

## Final Thoughts
- Helm simplifies complex Kubernetes deployments with reusable charts
- Kustomize is great for environment-specific configuration management without templates
- ArgoCD automates deployments, enforcing GitOps best practices
- Combining these tools maximizes efficiency and consistency in microservice architectures
